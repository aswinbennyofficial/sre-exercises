### Learning Outcomes
- Learn about the best practices for REST APIs.

### Problem Statement
- Create a student CRUD REST API using any programming language and web framework of your choice. You can choose to use any of the following:
    - Golang and Gin
    - Java and Spring Boot
    - Python and Flask
    - Node.js etc.

### Functional Requirement

    - Delete a student record.

### Expectations
The following expectations should be met to complete this milestone.

    - The repository should contain the following
        - README.md file explaining the purpose of the repo, along with local setup instructions.
        - Explicitly maintaining dependencies in a file ex (pom.xml, build.gradle, go.mod, requirements.txt, etc).
        - Makefile to build and run the REST API locally.
        - Ability to run DB schema migrations to create the student table.
        - Config (such as database URL) should not be hard-coded in the code and should be passed through environment variables.
        - Postman collection for the APIs.

- API expectations
    - Support API versioning (e.g., api/v1/<resource>).
    - Using proper HTTP verbs for different operations.
    - API should emit meaningful logs with appropriate log levels.
    - API should have a /healthcheck endpoint.
    - Unit tests for different endpoints.
